    This app is based on an excellent tutorial by James Q Quick. The link to that video is here: <a href="https://youtu.be/UU7MgYIbtAk">SvelteKit Crash Course</a> I added a background gradient, and switched up the Pokemon art to "official-image", and made my own card page that slightly resembles an actual Pokemon card. The other notable change I made was importing the UnoCSS engine into the project, I was able to accomplish all the Tailwind CSS classes without actually installing Tailwind. Very cool.
